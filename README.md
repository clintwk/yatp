Yet Another Tunnel Program (for TurtleCraft)

This tunnel program is designed to make a very fast 1x2 tunnel of a specified length. It will then add a number of branches is specified as well. In addition, any blocks placed in slot 1 will be used to build a bridge underneath the turtle. This program is much faster then other programs because it only goes forward during the initial tunnel construction saving A LOT of time. With the default tunnel program (which this program is loosely based off of) because the tunnel is a 3x3 tunnel, the turtle spends a lot of time turning and moving and as such, I can have around 4 turtles going at the same time and easily keep up with them. With this modified program, it's difficult to keep up with just one turtle! In addition, it allows for adding branches.
